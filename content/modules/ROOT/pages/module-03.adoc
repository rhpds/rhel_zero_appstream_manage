An update to the web application running on this system requires
features available in ruby 3.1. To accomplish this you will ultimately
remove ruby 3.0 and install ruby 3.1.

To start, how do you know that ruby 3.1 is availble? Additional software
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is shipped as an Application Stream.
Application Streams take several different forms, but ruby is packaged
and shipped as a module.

List the available ruby modules.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
dnf module list ruby
----

.Putput
[source,text]

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream(RPMs)
Name Stream Profiles Summary
ruby 3.1 common [d] An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language
ruby 3.3 common [d] An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language

Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled
----

From the above output, you can see that ruby 3.1 is available and can be installed on the system.

In order to upgrade the system, first remove ruby 3.0.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
dnf -y remove ruby
----

Take a look at the machine to validate the removal of ruby 3.0.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
dnf list ruby
----

.Output
[source,text]

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Available Packages
ruby.i686    3.0.7-162.el9_4  rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
ruby.x86_64  3.0.7-162.el9_4  rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpm

Previously, the dnf list showed ruby in the `+Installed Packages+`. Now
that it has been removed from the system, it is listed in the
`+Available Packages+`.
