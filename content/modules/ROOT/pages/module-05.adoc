Now that the ruby 3.1 is installed, you can also look at how the modular
package management is reported by `+dnf+`.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]

dnf module list ruby

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream
(RPMs) Name Stream Profiles Summary ruby 3.1 [e] common [d] [i] An
interpreter of object-oriented scripting language

Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled
----

From the above output, you can see that ruby 3.1 is the enabled `[e]` module and that it is installed `[i]` on the system.

As Red Hat releases updated application streams, you will use a similar process of removing the installed application stream and installing a newer one.
